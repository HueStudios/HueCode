HueCode

HueCode is a visual language developed by HueStudios to increase productivity.
It compiles to C# source code, which can be then compiled to .NET IL with a regular compiler.

Feel free to use the project in any way you want, but keep in mind that it comes with absolutely no guarantee. (And it's still in a very early development stage)
